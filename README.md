To display the value of an integer variable, we use the %d format specifier. Similarly:

%c is used to display character,

%f for float variable,

%s for string variable,

%If for double, and

%x for hexadecimal variable.

Steps to check the sum of two numbers are as follows:

In the program, assign some value to variable num1 and num2 at the time of declaration.

Then declare sum variable.

Add num1 and num2, and store the result in sum,

Display sum on screen using printf() function.

Algorithm:

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2, and sum

Step 3: Read values num1 and num2

Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum.

Step 5: Display sum

Step 6: Stop
