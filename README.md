Resources Required:

Hardware Requirement: Computer

Software Requirement: Dev C++ Software

Theory:

Addition is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, with the others being subtraction, multiplication, and division. The addition of two numbers is the total amount of those quantities combined. For example, 3+2=5 (i.e., 3 added to 2 is equal to 5).

printf() and scanf() functions are inbuilt library functions in C programming language which are available in the standard C library by default. The printf() function is used to display the output, and scanf() is used to take input from the user.
