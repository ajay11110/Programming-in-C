Objective:

Write a program to find the sum of 2 values by inputting these two values from the keyboard and then display the sum.

Resources Required:

Hardware Requirement: Computer

Software Requirement: Dev C++ Software

Theory:

Addition is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic with the others being subtraction, multiplication, and division. The addition of two numbers is the total amount of those quantities

combined. For example:

3+2=5, Le, 3 added to 2 is equal to 5.

printf() and scanf() functions are inbuilt library functions in the C programming language.

printf() is used to display the output.

scanf() is used to take input from the user.

The %d format specifier is used to display the value of an integer variable.

Other format specifiers include:

%c for character

%f for float

%s for string

%If for double

%x for hexadecimal

Steps to check the sum of two numbers are as follows:

The program will declare variables num1, num2, and sum.

The integer entered by the user is stored in variables num1 and num2.

Add num1 and num2, and store the result in the variable sum.

Display the sum on screen using the printf() function.
